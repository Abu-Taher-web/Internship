“tly investigate the application placement and load distribution challenges in an EC-enabled mobile network. We propose a hierarchical distributed Limited Look-Ahead Control (LLC) approach that mitigates centralized control bottlenecks by breaking down the overall decision problem into a series of local problems solved cooperatively through a two-tier architecture. The global controller processes system-wide information and sets local constraints, while local controller” ([Maia et al., 2025, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/JUSCLC76)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EVIGPMMI?page=1&annotation=QIPRDIC2))

“Therefore, EC creates a new computational layer between end-user devices and cloud data centers, where applications can be deployed on nearby EC nodes to process data close to its sources, improving response time and alleviating network congestion” ([Maia et al., 2025, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/JUSCLC76)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EVIGPMMI?page=1&annotation=AE93RQZW))

“A key service delivery issue in EC is application placement, which maps the deployment of applications across EC nodes based on specific constraints, and performance goals” ([Maia et al., 2025, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/JUSCLC76)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EVIGPMMI?page=1&annotation=74GGZFHW))
