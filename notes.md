### Title: SDN enhanced resource orchestration for industrial IoT in collaborative edge cloud networks.
**Notes:**
- Service level agreement:
- Constrain satisfaction problem:
- ROI: 
- Savile row:
- Essense prime:
- HVAC: Heating, Ventilation and air conditioning. 
- NP hard optmization problem are solved using prime essense language.
- CloudSimDN, PureEdgeSim are simulation software
- the solver takes 0.47 to 0.5 ms to solve the constrained proble.
- the resource orchestration improves 4% task success.

**Summary:**
The author made a topology in a simulation software and then tested his ideas. This paper proposes a resource allocation methods in two steps. In first step you heve to identify the numbers of edge server you would like to deploy, what kind of application you would run on the network etc. You have to formulate a constrained optimization problem. After solving it using the solver (Essense Prime language) SDN will assign the resources to each edge server. In this way resource utilization will be efficient. 

**Comments:**
- IoT has heterogenus nature but I don't think it is unpredictable.
